# Nest Mongo

A simple RESTful server built with Nest.js and MongoDB. This is an experimental project to learn Express.js from Fireship's video [RESTful APIs in 100 Seconds // Build an API from Scratch with Node.js Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTSQjw5DrM).

However, I find it too simple in this video, so I decided to dive deeper into the newest version of Nest.js and MongoDB, with Academind's video [Learn Nest.js from Scratch by building an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_oOtaxb0L8) and [Nest.js with MongoDB - Complete Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulfU5vY6I78).
